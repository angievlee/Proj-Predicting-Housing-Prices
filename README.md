# Project 2 - Ames Housing Data and Kaggle Challenge



## Problem Statement
<br>
People are inheriting houses, that are located in Ames, IA, from their recently deceased elderly relative. People are unsure on whether it's better to keep or sell the inherited house. Because houses have a considerable range of features to consider, a model can be used to predict sale price (i.e. value of a inherited house) based on designated features.

## Executive Summary
<br>
<br>
My approach was to research Ames, IA by gathering insight on population, average age, environment conditions(i.e. rural, distance to nearest metro, weather, etc), industry, and local landmarks to understand the lifestyle a person living in Ames, IA would have. That insight may be used to encapsulate a package of expectations and necessities for someone who may be considering moving, visiting, or living part-time in Ames, IA. Ultimately, I wanted to highlight incentives for either keeping the inerited house or selling dependent on what an individual may envision for his/her life. 
<br>
<br>
From there, I wanted to compile a set of features that a relative who is inherited a house may reference to determine the cost of his/her inherited house. Additionally, should the house be limited in its current state, which features may be added to boost the value of the inherited house.
<br>
<br>
I hypothesized that "building type", which is the structural design of a house(e.g. one-story structure, multi-story structure, townhouse, etc) would be one of the main features that substantially predicts an inherited house's current value and potential value. 
<br>
<br>
And while "building type" did influence sale price, ultimately a house's distance from 'proximity conditions', those of which are industrial/often man made structures, was a strong feature to predict sale price. Moreover, kitchen quality and basement level quality are noted to be features that are upgradeable and available for homes whereas proximity conditions are external factors that cannot be easily changed, if at all, by a homeowner.
<br>
<br>
If I had additional time, I would have explored the cost of maintenance for a house's given feature(s). I would then subtract that cost from inherited house sale price to attain ROI(return on investment). The maintenance cost must be considered even if there are intended plans to sell a house as there is still preparation costs involved in making sure a house is presentable and ready to be sold.

## Conclusion and Next Steps
<br>
1. Test model with data from most recent years(2019, 2018, 2017). 
<br>
2. Inherited homeowners have options to rent out, setup AirBnb, or use house as a summer home which may influence the features they wish to add to inherited house.
<br>
3. Because Ames, IA has one of the lowest unemployment rates at 1.5%, there will be people looking for a place to live as there are more jobs than people so ROI for inherited homeowner is a possible consideration.
